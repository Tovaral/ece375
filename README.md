OSU ECE 375
===========

Assignments and labs for Oregon State's Fall 2015 ECE 375.

All and code is (C) 2015 Ian Kronquist, all rights reserved, unless otherwise noted.

Consulting the code for the logic details & which bits are set is encouraged.

Copying the code or its structure (i.e. program control flow) is probably plagiarism and will be reported.


The file `m128def.inc` is distributed with the assembler.
If I recall correctly it may be installed with homebrew or built from source.
