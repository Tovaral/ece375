Most of the labs you do will have study questions that are to be answered within your lab write-up.  This lab’s study questions are given below and will be due at the start of lab next week
. Although you will be exposed to some information that has not been covered 
in class, keep in mind that as a student accepted into pro school you will need to get into the habit of being pro-active.  This involves reading ahead and preparing yourself before going to lab or class.

1.  Go to the lab webpage and download the template write-up. Read it thoroughly and get familiar with the expected format.  Specifically look at the included source code. What type of font is used? What size is the font?  From here o n when you include your source code in your lab write-up you must adhere to that font type and size .

2.  Take a look at the code you downloaded for today’s lab. Notice the lines that begin with .def and .equ followed by some type of expression. These are known as pre-compiler directives . Define pre-compiler directive. What is the difference between the .def and .equ directives (HINT: see section 5.1 of the AVR Starter Guide given on the lab webpage).

3.  Take another look at the code you downloaded for today’s lab. Read the comment that describes the macro definitions. From that explanation determine the 8-bit binary value of the following expressions. Note: the numbers below are decimal values.

a.
(1<<2)
00000100
b.
(2<<1)
00000100
c.
(4>>1)
00000010
d.
(1<<4)
00010000
